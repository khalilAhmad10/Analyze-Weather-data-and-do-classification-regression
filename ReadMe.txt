The objective of this project is to analyze the weather data and extract the hypotheses to arrive at a prediction.

Dataset: weather prediction dataset(weatherHistory.csv) 
	â€¢ Available at: https://github.com/martandsingh/datasets/blob/master/weatherHistory.csv

2 tasks are done.
	1). classification
	2). regression

Data cleaning and outliers removel techniques are also applied

For classification 4 methods are used DecisionTreeClassifier,SVM, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier.
For regression 3 algorithms are used that are LinearRegression, polynomial regression, and SVR.
